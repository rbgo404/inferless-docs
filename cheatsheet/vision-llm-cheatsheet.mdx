## 10. Common Challenges & Troubleshooting

- **Data Quality & Domain Gaps:** Real-world images may differ from training data (e.g., poor lighting, different angles). Poor performance often stems from domain mismatch. Fine-tuning on in-domain examples can help bridge these gaps.
- **Computational Complexity:** Vision-language models can be large and computationally expensive. Optimizing memory usage and inference speed is crucial to avoid latency bottlenecks in production.
- **Debugging Multimodal Outputs:** Understanding why a model produces certain visual or textual outputs can be more complex compared to text-only models. Tools that visualize attention maps or produce intermediate embeddings can aid troubleshooting.

## 11. Ethical Considerations

- **Privacy & Consent:** Models trained on large-scale image data might inadvertently include personal images or metadata. Mechanisms for data filtering and compliance with privacy regulations are essential.
- **Biases in Visual Recognition:** Unbalanced or unrepresentative training data can lead to inaccurate or biased outcomes, potentially marginalizing certain demographic groups or cultural contexts.
- **Intellectual Property Rights:** Ensure that images used for training or inference do not infringe upon copyright or licensing agreements. Properly attribute and respect usage limitations for externally sourced visual data.

## 12. Licensing & Governance

- **Check Licenses:** As with any open-source software, verify the license of each model or dataset (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL) to ensure compatibility with commercial or proprietary products.
- **Hugging Face Model Cards:** Model cards provide transparency around training data, intended use, and limitations. Reviewing these is critical when deciding how to integrate or modify a model.
- **Data Usage Agreements:** Confirm that your usage adheres to dataset terms and conditions. Some datasets prohibit certain commercial applications or require explicit attribution to the data source.
