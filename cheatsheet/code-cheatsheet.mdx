## 10. Common Challenges & Troubleshooting

- **Model Transparency**: Generative Models function as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes, which can hinder debugging and trust.
- **Computational Resources**: Inferencing large models demands significant computational power, posing accessibility challenges for some organizations.
- **Security and Ethical Concerns**: There's a risk of models being misused to generate malicious code, necessitating the implementation of safeguards.
- **Integration Challenges**: Incorporating these models into existing development workflows requires ensuring compatibility with current tools and practices.

## 11. Ethical Considerations

- **Code Attribution and Licensing**: Ensure proper attribution of generated code and respect for existing software licenses and intellectual property rights.
- **Bias and Fairness**: Address potential biases in code generation that might create discriminatory outcomes.
- **Developer Dependency**: Consider the impact on developer skills and ensure the tool enhances rather than replaces human programming capabilities.
- **Data Privacy**: Protect sensitive information in code repositories and ensure compliance with data protection regulations when training or using these models.
- **Quality Assurance**: Establish guidelines for reviewing and validating AI-generated code to maintain code quality and security standards.

## 12. Licensing & Governance

- **Check Licenses:** (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL) before commercial use.
- **Hugging Face Model Cards:** Follow best practices for transparency.
- **Data Usage Agreements:** Ensure compliance with dataset terms.
