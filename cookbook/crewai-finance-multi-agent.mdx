title: "Build a Multi-Agent Financial Analysis System"
description: "Dive into this comprehensive tutorial that guides you through building a sophisticated multi-agent system for financial analysis. Learn how to leverage multiple AI agents, powered by large language models, to perform detailed stock analysis and generate financial investment reports."
---
## Key Components of the Application
1. __LLaMA Model:__ Meta's LLaMA 3.1 70B model serves as the core reasoning engine, powering natural language understanding and generation for sophisticated financial analysis and report creation.
2. __Ollama Integration:__ Provides local deployment of the LLaMA model with efficient model management, optimization, and streamlined quantization (Q4_K_L) for faster analysis.
3. __CrewAI Framework:__ Orchestrates the interaction between agents, managing task execution and tool integration for complex financial analysis workflows.\
   Key CrewAI Components:
   - __Agents:__ Specialized roles (Researcher, Analyst, Advisor)
   - __Tasks:__ Structured workflow definitions
   - __Tools:__ Integration with financial data sources
   - __Crew:__ Coordination and process management

## Crafting Your Application
The system follows a sequential processing architecture where each agent performs specialized tasks:

## Core Development Steps
- __Objective:__ Accept user input and Create a robust framework for multi-agent coordination.
- __Action:__  Implement the InferlessPythonModel class that handles initialization, inference, and agent creation.

### Alternative Deployment Method
Inferless also supports a user-friendly UI for model deployment, catering to users at all skill levels. Refer to Inferless's documentation for guidance on UI-based deployment.
## Choosing Inferless for Deployment
Deploying your Voice Conversational Chatbot application with Inferless offers compelling advantages, making your development journey smoother and more cost-effective. Here's why Inferless is the go-to choice:
1. __Ease of Use:__ Forget the complexities of infrastructure management. With Inferless, you simply bring your model, and within minutes, you have a working endpoint. Deployment is hassle-free, without the need for in-depth knowledge of scaling or infrastructure maintenance.
2. __Cold-start Times:__ Inferless's unique load balancing ensures faster cold-starts. Expect around 72.19 seconds to process each queries, significantly faster than many traditional platforms.
3. __Cost Efficiency:__ Inferless optimizes resource utilization, translating to lower operational costs. Here's a simplified cost comparison:

### Scenario 1
You are looking to deploy a Voice Conversational Chatbot application for processing 100 queries.<br />

__Parameters:__
- __Total number of queries:__ 100 daily.<br />
- __Inference Time:__ All models are hypothetically deployed on A100 80GB, taking 72.19 seconds of processing time and a cold start overhead of 21.09 seconds.<br />
- __Scale Down Timeout:__ Uniformly 60 seconds across all platforms, except Hugging Face, which requires a minimum of 15 minutes. This is assumed to happen 100 times a day.<br />

__Key Computations:__
1. __Inference Duration:__ <br/>
Processing 100 queries and each takes 72.19 seconds<br/>
Total: 100 x 72.19 = 7219 seconds (or approximately 2 hours)
2. __Idle Timeout Duration:__<br/>
Post-processing idle time before scaling down: (100 seconds - 72.19 seconds) x 100 = 2781 seconds (or 0.77 hours approximately)<br/>
3. __Cold Start Overhead:__<br/>
Total: 100 x 21.09 = 2109 seconds (or 0.59 hours approximately)<br/>

__Total Billable Hours with Inferless:__ 2 (inference duration) + 0.77 (idle time) + 0.59 (cold start overhead)  = 3.36 hours<br/>
__Total Billable Hours with Inferless:__ 3.36 hours<br/>

### Scenario 2
You are looking to deploy a Voice Conversational Chatbot application for processing 1000 queries per day.<br />

__Key Computations:__<br />
1. __Inference Duration:__<br />
Processing 1000 queries and each takes 72.19 seconds
Total: 1000 x 72.19 = 72000 seconds (or approximately 7.94 hours)‍
2. __Idle Timeout Duration:__<br />
Post-processing idle time before scaling down: (100 seconds - 72.19 seconds) x 100 = 2781 seconds (or 0.77 hours approximately)
3. __Cold Start Overhead:__<br />
Total: 100 x 21.09 = 2109 seconds (or 0.59 hours approximately)

__Total Billable Hours with Inferless:__ 20 (inference duration) + 0.77 (idle time) + 0.59 (cold start overhead)  = 21.36 hours<br/>
__Total Billable Hours with Inferless:__ 21.36 hours

### Pricing Comparison for all the Scenario

| Scenarios | AWS SageMaker Cost | Inferless Cost |
| :--- | :---- | :---- |
|  100 requests/day | \$28.8 (24 hours billed at $1.22/hour) | \$2.73 (2.24 hours billed at $1.22/hour) |
|  1000 requests/day | \$28.8 (24 hours billed at $1.22/hour) | \$26.05 (21.36 hours billed at $1.22/hour) |

By opting for Inferless, **_you can achieve up to 90.52% cost savings._**<br/>

Please note that we have utilized the A100(80 GB) GPU for model benchmarking purposes, while for pricing comparison, we referenced the A10G GPU price from both platforms. This is due to the unavailability of the A100 GPU in SageMaker.

Also, the above analysis is based on a smaller-scale scenario for demonstration purposes. Should the scale increase tenfold, traditional cloud services might require maintaining 2-4 GPUs constantly active to manage peak loads efficiently. In contrast, Inferless, with its dynamic scaling capabilities, adeptly adjusts to fluctuating demand without the need for continuously running hardware.<br/>
