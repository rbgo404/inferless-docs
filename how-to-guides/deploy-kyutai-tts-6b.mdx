title: "Deploy the Kyutai-tts-1.6b model using Inferless"
description: "A real-time streaming text-to-speech model with 1.6B parameters that delivers ultra-low latency speech synthesis with voice conditioning, supporting English and French languages with word-level timestamps and streaming text input for production-ready voice applications."
---

## Introduction

[Kyutai-tts-1.6b](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-1.6b-en_fr) is an open-source, 1.6-billion-parameter text-to-speech model that revolutionizes speech synthesis by enabling real-time streaming generation with ultra-low latency. Unlike traditional TTS models, Kyutai TTS can process streaming text input as it's being generated by an LLM, producing immediate audio output with just 220ms latency and achieving over 2x real-time speed performance.

Under the hood, Kyutai TTS is powered by Kyutai's innovative delayed streams modeling architecture, the same technique that enables their groundbreaking Moshi conversational AI. This approach allows the model to perform voice conditioning through cross-attention embeddings using just a 10-second audio sample, matching the voice, intonation, mannerisms, and recording quality of the source. The model supports efficient batching for production environments, capable of processing up to 32 simultaneous streams on an L40S GPU with maintained quality across both English and French languages. Released under the CC-BY-4.0 license and trained on 2.5 million hours of audio data, Kyutai TTS represents a new paradigm in accessible, production-ready speech synthesis technology.


## Defining Dependencies

We are using the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) to serve the model on a single A100 (80GB).

## Constructing the GitHub/GitLab Template

Now quickly construct the GitHub/GitLab template, this process is mandatory and make sure you don't add any file named `model.py`.

```
kyutai-tts-1.6b/
├── app.py
├── inferless-runtime-config.yaml
└── inferless.yaml
```

You can also add other files to this directory.

## Create the Input Schema with Pydantic

Using the `inferless` Python client and Pydantic, you can define structured schemas directly in your code for input and output, eliminating the need for external file.

### Input Schema
When defining an input schema with Pydantic, you need to annotate your class attributes with the appropriate types, such as `str`, `float`, `int`, `bool` etc. 
These type annotations specifys what type of data each field should contain. 
The `default` value serves as the example input for testing with the `infer` function.

```python
@inferless.request
class RequestObjects(BaseModel):
    text: str = Field(default="Hey there! How are you? I had the craziest day today.")
    voice: Optional[str] = "expresso/ex03-ex01_happy_001_channel1_334s.wav"
    cfg_coef: Optional[float] = 2.0
    padding_between: Optional[int] = 1
```

### Output Schema
The `@inferless.response` decorator helps you define structured output schemas.

```python
@inferless.response
class ResponseObjects(BaseModel):
    audio_base64: str = Field(default="Test Output")
```

### Usage in the `infer` Function
Once you have annotated the objects you can expect the infer function to receive `RequestObjects` as input,
and returns a `ResponseObjects` instance as output, ensuring the results adhere to a defined structure.

```python
class InferlessPythonModel:
    def infer(self, request: RequestObjects) -> ResponseObjects:
        
        return ResponseObject(**return_result)
```

## Create the class for inference

In the [app.py](https://github.com/inferless/kyutai-tts-1.6b/blob/main/app.py) we will define the class and import all the required functions

1.  `def initialize`: In this function, you will initialize your model and define any `variable` that you want to use during inference.

2.  `def infer`: This function gets called for every request that you send. Here you can define all the steps that are required for the inference.

3.  `def finalize`: This function cleans up all the allocated memory.

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
from moshi.models.loaders import CheckpointInfo
from moshi.models.tts import DEFAULT_DSM_TTS_REPO, TTSModel
from typing import Optional
import base64
import io
import wave
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
import inferless
import os

os.environ["HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER"] = '1'

@inferless.request
class RequestObjects(BaseModel):
    text: str = Field(default="Hey there! How are you? I had the craziest day today.")
    voice: Optional[str] = "expresso/ex03-ex01_happy_001_channel1_334s.wav"
    cfg_coef: Optional[float] = 2.0
    padding_between: Optional[int] = 1

@inferless.response
class ResponseObjects(BaseModel):
    audio_base64: str = Field(default="Test Output")

class InferlessPythonModel:
    def initialize(self):
        # Load the checkpoint info and TTS model
        checkpoint_info = CheckpointInfo.from_hf_repo(DEFAULT_DSM_TTS_REPO)
        self.tts_model = TTSModel.from_checkpoint_info(
            checkpoint_info, 
            n_q=32, 
            temp=0.6, 
            device=torch.device("cuda")
        )


    def _on_frame(self, frame, pcms):
        """Frame callback function for audio generation"""
        if (frame != -1).all():
            pcm = self.tts_model.mimi.decode(frame[:, 1:, :]).cpu().numpy()
            pcms.append(np.clip(pcm[0, 0], -1, 1))

    def infer(self, inputs: RequestObjects) -> ResponseObjects:
        # Prepare the script
        entries = self.tts_model.prepare_script([inputs.text], padding_between=inputs.padding_between)
        
        # Get voice path
        voice_path = self.tts_model.get_voice_path(inputs.voice)
        
        # Make condition attributes
        condition_attributes = self.tts_model.make_condition_attributes(
            [voice_path], cfg_coef=inputs.cfg_coef
        )
        
        # Generate audio
        pcms = []
        
        # Create a lambda function that captures the pcms list
        frame_callback = lambda frame: self._on_frame(frame, pcms)

        all_entries = [entries]
        all_condition_attributes = [condition_attributes]
        
        with self.tts_model.mimi.streaming(len(all_entries)):
            result = self.tts_model.generate(all_entries, all_condition_attributes, on_frame=frame_callback)
        
        # Concatenate audio frames
        audio = np.concatenate(pcms, axis=-1)
        
        # Convert to base64
        audio_base64 = self._audio_to_base64(audio, sample_rate=24000)
        
        return ResponseObjects(
            audio_base64=audio_base64
        )

    def _audio_to_base64(self, audio_array, sample_rate=24000):
        # Ensure audio is in the right format
        audio_array = np.clip(audio_array, -1, 1)
        audio_int16 = (audio_array * 32767).astype(np.int16)
        
        # Create WAV file in memory
        buf = io.BytesIO()
        with wave.open(buf, 'wb') as wav_file:
            wav_file.setnchannels(1)  # Mono
            wav_file.setsampwidth(2)  # 16-bit
            wav_file.setframerate(sample_rate)
            wav_file.writeframes(audio_int16.tobytes())
        
        # Encode to base64
        buf.seek(0)
        encoded = base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode()
        return encoded

    def finalize(self):
        self.tts_model = None
```

## Creating the Custom Runtime

This is a mandatory step where we allow the users to upload their custom runtime through [inferless-runtime-config.yaml](https://github.com/inferless/kyutai-tts-1.6b/blob/main/inferless-runtime-config.yaml).

```python
build:
  cuda_version: "12.1.1"
  python_packages:
    - sphn==0.1.12
    - moshi==0.2.10
    - hf-transfer==0.1.9
    - huggingface-hub==0.33.1
    - pydantic==2.11.7
    - inferless==0.2.15
```


## Test your model with Remote Run

You can use the `inferless remote-run`([installation guide here](https://docs.inferless.com/model-import/cli-import#cli-import)) command to test your model or any custom Python script in a remote GPU environment directly from your local machine. Make sure that you use `Python3.10` for seamless experience.

### Step 1: Add the Decorators and local entry point
To enable **Remote Run**, simply do the following:
1. Import the `inferless` library and initialize `Cls(gpu="A10")`. The available GPU options are `T4`, `A10` and `A100`.
2. Decorated the `initialize` and `infer` functions with `@app.load` and `@app.infer` respectively.
3. Create the Local Entry Point by decorating a function (for example, `my_local_entry`) with `@inferless.local_entry_point`. 
Within this function, instantiate your model class, convert any incoming parameters into a `RequestObjects` object, and invoke the model's `infer` method. 

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
from moshi.models.loaders import CheckpointInfo
from moshi.models.tts import DEFAULT_DSM_TTS_REPO, TTSModel
from typing import Optional
import base64
import io
import wave
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
import inferless
import os

os.environ["HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER"] = '1'

app = inferless.Cls(gpu="A10")

@inferless.request
class RequestObjects(BaseModel):
    text: str = Field(default="Hey there! How are you? I had the craziest day today.")
    voice: Optional[str] = "expresso/ex03-ex01_happy_001_channel1_334s.wav"
    cfg_coef: Optional[float] = 2.0
    padding_between: Optional[int] = 1

@inferless.response
class ResponseObjects(BaseModel):
    audio_base64: str = Field(default="Test Output")

class InferlessPythonModel:
    @app.load
    def initialize(self):
        # Load the checkpoint info and TTS model
        checkpoint_info = CheckpointInfo.from_hf_repo(DEFAULT_DSM_TTS_REPO)
        self.tts_model = TTSModel.from_checkpoint_info(
            checkpoint_info, 
            n_q=32, 
            temp=0.6, 
            device=torch.device("cuda")
        )


    def _on_frame(self, frame, pcms):
        """Frame callback function for audio generation"""
        if (frame != -1).all():
            pcm = self.tts_model.mimi.decode(frame[:, 1:, :]).cpu().numpy()
            pcms.append(np.clip(pcm[0, 0], -1, 1))
    
    @app.infer
    def infer(self, inputs: RequestObjects) -> ResponseObjects:
        # Prepare the script
        entries = self.tts_model.prepare_script([inputs.text], padding_between=inputs.padding_between)
        
        # Get voice path
        voice_path = self.tts_model.get_voice_path(inputs.voice)
        
        # Make condition attributes
        condition_attributes = self.tts_model.make_condition_attributes(
            [voice_path], cfg_coef=inputs.cfg_coef
        )
        
        # Generate audio
        pcms = []
        
        # Create a lambda function that captures the pcms list
        frame_callback = lambda frame: self._on_frame(frame, pcms)

        all_entries = [entries]
        all_condition_attributes = [condition_attributes]
        
        with self.tts_model.mimi.streaming(len(all_entries)):
            result = self.tts_model.generate(all_entries, all_condition_attributes, on_frame=frame_callback)
        
        # Concatenate audio frames
        audio = np.concatenate(pcms, axis=-1)
        
        # Convert to base64
        audio_base64 = self._audio_to_base64(audio, sample_rate=24000)
        
        return ResponseObjects(
                audio_base64=audio_base64
        )

    def _audio_to_base64(self, audio_array, sample_rate=24000):
        # Ensure audio is in the right format
        audio_array = np.clip(audio_array, -1, 1)
        audio_int16 = (audio_array * 32767).astype(np.int16)
        
        # Create WAV file in memory
        buf = io.BytesIO()
        with wave.open(buf, 'wb') as wav_file:
            wav_file.setnchannels(1)  # Mono
            wav_file.setsampwidth(2)  # 16-bit
            wav_file.setframerate(sample_rate)
            wav_file.writeframes(audio_int16.tobytes())
        
        # Encode to base64
        buf.seek(0)
        encoded = base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode()
        return encoded

    def finalize(self):
        self.tts_model = None

@inferless.local_entry_point
def my_local_entry(dynamic_params):
    request_objects = RequestObjects(**dynamic_params)
    model_instance = InferlessPythonModel()

    return model_instance.infer(request_objects)
```

### Step 2: Run with Remote GPU

From your local terminal, navigate to the folder containing your `app.py` and your `inferless-runtime-config.yaml` and run:

```bash
inferless remote-run app.py -c inferless-runtime-config.yaml --text "Hey there! How are you? I had the craziest day today."
```

You can pass the other input parameters in the same way (e.g., `--confidence_threshold`, etc.) as long as your code expects them in the `inputs` dictionary.

If you want to exclude certain files or directories from being uploaded, use the `--exclude` or `-e` flag.


## Method A: Deploying the model on Inferless Platform
Inferless supports multiple ways of [importing your model](https://docs.inferless.com/model-import/file-structure-req/file-structure-requirements). For this tutorial, we will use GitHub.

### Step 1: Login to the inferless dashboard can click on Import model button
Navigate to your desired workspace in Inferless and Click on `Add a custom model` button that you see on the top right. An import wizard will open up.

### Step 2: Follow the UI to complete the model  Import
- Select the GitHub/GitLab Integration option to connect your source code repository with the deployment environment.
- Navigate to the specific GitHub repository that contains your model's code. Here, you will need to identify and enter the name of the model you wish to import.
- Choose the appropriate type of machine that suits your model's requirements. Additionally, specify the minimum and maximum number of replicas to define the scalability range for deploying your model.
- Optionally, you have the option to enable automatic build and deployment. This feature triggers a new deployment automatically whenever there is a new code push to your repository.
- If your model requires additional software packages, configure the Custom Runtime settings by including necessary pip or apt packages. Also, set up environment variables such as  Inference Timeout, Container Concurrency, and Scale Down Timeout to tailor the runtime environment according to your needs.
- Wait for the validation process to complete, ensuring that all settings are correct and functional. Once validation is successful, click on the "Import" button to finalize the import of your model.

### Step 3: Wait for the model build to complete usually takes ~5-10 minutes

### Step 4: Use the APIs to call the model
Once the model is in 'Active' status you can click on the 'API' page to call the model

### Here is the Demo:

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="/videos/demo-kyutai.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>


## Method B: Deploying the model on Inferless CLI

Inferless allows you to deploy your model using Inferless-CLI. Follow the steps to deploy using Inferless CLI.

### Clone the repository of the model
Let's begin by cloning the model repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/inferless/kyutai-tts-1.6b.git
```

### Deploy the Model
To deploy the model using Inferless CLI, execute the following command:
```bash
inferless deploy --gpu A10 --runtime inferless-runtime-config.yaml
```

**Explanation of the Command:**

- `--gpu A10`: Specifies the GPU type for deployment. Available options include `A10`, `A100`, and `T4`.
- `--runtime inferless-runtime-config.yaml`: Defines the runtime configuration file. If not specified, the default Inferless runtime is used.
